# Technical_Screener

This project was built based on this video [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdlFhF6gjKo&t=2s&ab_channel=PartTimeLarry), the original source code is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdlFhF6gjKo&t=2s&ab_channel=PartTimeLarry). I have add a new functionality so that the screener can screen not only the candlestick patterns but also the indulstry sector.

## Future ideas
1. Make the datasets up-to-date when the flask is run
2. Order the stocks based on average volumn
